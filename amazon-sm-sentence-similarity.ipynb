    "First, we fine tune pretrained `bert-base-uncased` model from `HuggingFace Library` in an unsupervised fashion, on `Industrial labor accident data`. The objective is to find the similar accident reports based on the description of the incident using `bert-base-uncased`. \n",

    "Second, we train an linear learner classification model using incident features and similar incidents' features.\n",

    "At the end, we deploy an inference pipeline which takes an incident report as input and predict the accident type."
